# Radio Music Box

I have music files on my personal computer that I want to stream to my work on the same network. This seems simple, but all the solutions are complicated. So, I made the simple solution: run a server pointed at your music collection, visit a web page, press the play button. It will shuffle your songs and finds anything it can play in the directory tree.

## Building
It's Rust, so install Rust and then do `cargo build --release`.
